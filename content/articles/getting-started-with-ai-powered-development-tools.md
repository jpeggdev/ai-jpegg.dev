## Best Practices

When integrating AI tools into your workflow:

 1. **Start Small**: Begin with simple tasks like code completion
 2. **Verify Output**: Always review and test AI-generated code
 3. **Learn Patterns**: Use AI suggestions to learn new coding patterns
 4. **Maintain Context**: Provide clear context for better AI assistance

## The Future

As AI tools continue to evolve, we're moving toward a collaborative development model where human creativity combines with AI efficiency. The key is learning to work alongside these tools rather than relying on them entirely.

The future of development isn't about AI replacing developersâ€”it's about augmenting human capabilities to build better software faster.
